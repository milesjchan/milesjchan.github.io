title: "Intestines of non-uniform stiffness mold the corners of wombat feces"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2021-01-21-wombats/
excerpt: 'Using histology and tensile testing, we discover that the cross-section of the intestine exhibits regions with a two-fold increase in thickness and a four-fold increase in stiffness, which we hypothesize facilitates the formation of corners by contractions of the intestine.'
