*Miles competing in the bike leg of a 70.3 triathlon.*

I have a lot of fun training with the fine folks of the [Caltech Triathlon Club](https://triathlon.clubs.caltech.edu/). Occasionally, I coach the running and cycling workouts. I particularly enjoy riding my bicycle in the mountains, pushing fast intervals on the track, and running on flowy singletrack trail.
