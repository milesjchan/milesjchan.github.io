*Hammering on the bike in my first 70.3 triathlon*

I enjoy training with the fine folks of the [Caltech Triathlon Club](https://triathlon.clubs.caltech.edu/). Every other week, I coach the run workouts. Cycling in the mountains, fast intervals on the track, and trail running are my current favorite physical activities.
