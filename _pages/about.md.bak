I am a PhD student in the Graduate Aerospace Laboratories at Caltech ([GALCIT](https://galcit.caltech.edu/)), working with [Dr. Beverley McKeon](https://mckeon.caltech.edu) on reduced order modeling of wall-bounded turbulent flows using resolvent analysis. Turbulence is a very practical issue, since it is responsible for most of the drag in many engineering systems. I am very excited about the possibility of recovering features and statistics of turbulent flows by using the latest developments in equation-based and data-driven analysis tools.

I completed my undergraduate studies at Georgia Tech, where I conducted research with [Dr. David Hu](https://hu.gatech.edu/) and [Dr. Patricia Yang](https://www.patriciayang.net/) on how wombats make cubic feces. This work features a cool application of mechanical principles to explain how an unintuitive phenomenon in nature. My time
