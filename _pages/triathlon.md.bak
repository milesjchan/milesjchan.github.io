*Finishing my first Olympic Triathlon with a smile*

I enjoy training with the fine folks of the [Caltech Triathlon Club](https://triathlon.clubs.caltech.edu/). Every other week, I coach the run workouts. Running is my strongest area, but I have learned to appreciate the gorgeous cycling and ocean swimming available in Los Angeles.
