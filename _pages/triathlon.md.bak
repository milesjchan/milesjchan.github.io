![Miles finishing his first Olympic Triathlon]({{ base_path }}/images/miles_caltrila.jpg)
*Finishing my first Olympic Triathlon with a smile*

Staying physically active is important to me. I've always been a runner, but I've lately appreciated adding cycling and swimming to my repetoire. I enjoy training and racing with the fine people of the [Caltech Triathlon Club](https://triathlon.clubs.caltech.edu/).
