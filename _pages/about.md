I am a PhD candidate in the Graduate Aerospace Laboratories at Caltech ([GALCIT](https://galcit.caltech.edu/)), working with [Dr. Beverley McKeon](https://mckeon.caltech.edu). My research focuses on interrogating and modeling the physics of near-wall turbulence in the presence of surface texture, using data from numerical simulations and analysis of the Navier-Stokes resolvent operator.

I completed my undergraduate studies at Georgia Tech, where I conducted research with [Dr. David Hu](https://hu.gatech.edu/) and [Dr. Patricia Yang](https://www.patriciayang.net/) on how wombats make cubic feces. This work features a cool application of mechanical principles to explain an unintuitive phenomenon in nature.
