<h2>Teaching</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Teaching Assistant - Ae150 Aerospace Engineering Seminar (Caltech 10/2020-6/2021) </li>
</ul>

<h2>Outreach</h2>

When presenting on science and engineering to students, I emphasize that the research I do is accessible. I hope to inspire more students to pursue STEAM careers. I firmly believe that progress in science benefits from increased representation and diversity, and my outreach efforts focus on underserved and underrepresented communities.
