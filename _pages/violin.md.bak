I find playing the violin to be quite stimulating. Performing well demands a certain dedication to the craft of music-making, which involves technique, artistic vision, communication, collaboration, and devotion. My approach has been deeply influenced by my teachers, including Frank Yu, Kwok-Ping Koo, Dr. Camilla Kolchinsky, and Victor Voitsehkovski. My quartet plays a few times a year at the [Caltech Chamber Music](https://pva.caltech.edu/music/chambermusic) concerts and events around Pasadena.
