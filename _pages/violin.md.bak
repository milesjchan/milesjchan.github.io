I've been playing the violin since I was five years old. My approach to music and life has been deeply influenced by my teachers, including Frank Yu, Kwok-Ping Koo, Dr. Camilla Kolchinsky, and Victor Voitsehkovski. Knowing how to maintain composure and positive energy on stage is a skill that goes far beyond the concert hall.

I have played in small chamber orchestras and large symphonies, notably the El Camino Youth Symphony under Dr. Kolchinsky in my high school years. Since Fall 2019, working with my Caltech Chamber Music quartet has been quite wonderful. We've explored new repetoire and I've learned much from my colleagues Sze Him Lee, Ziyun Zhang, and Sam Davis. I'm thankful for the wonderful mentorship of Maia Jasper White and Martin Chalifour in this regard.
