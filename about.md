I'll never forget my first flight in a little Piper Cherokee. My pilot and I got the aircraft high above snow covered, wintry North Carolina, and started cycling through the flaps settings. I had formed a longitudinal aircraft pitch model as part of my internship, and now I had the opportunity to feel the physical manifestation of the interactions between the wing downwash and horizontal stabilizer. Seeing the unintuitive effects I had familiarized myself with in real life made me incredibly happy.

I'm passionate about the fundamentals. I love it when I can explore and build my understanding of a physical phenomena. It's even more gratifying to use my modeling to support the creation of something new and exciting.

Notable experiences include:
- Research
  - Physical reason for wombat cubic scat
- Internships
  - Aircraft point loads generation and development of automated plastic bending tool
  - Data analysis and modeling of ground effect on stall angle of attack
