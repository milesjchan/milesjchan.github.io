<h3>Summary</h3>
The sophomore level mechanical engineering design class at Georgia Tech is called ME2110. Students design and build autonomous machines to play a game conceived by the course instructors. Generally, machines have to extend to the center of the field to accomplish a high point value game task, and they must defend their side of the field, sweeping certain game pieces in or out for points. Four machines are on the field at a time, and the 2 teams with the highest point values at the end of a 1 minute round advance.

The first challenge is to understand the problem. Most students, when asked what the machine design goal should be, respond along the lines of "score as many points as possible" or "maximize points scored while keeping the machine as simple as possible." As the competition draws closer, and reality starts to set in, the answer morphs into "perform some sort of coordinated motion so we don't get DQ'ed and I can get an A and move on with my life."

My team reached the finals of this competition, and one major reason we got that far is because we had a more nuanced understanding of the problem. We knew that it wasn't the actual number of points scored that mattered, but that a positive point differential was generated with two other teams on the field. We allowed this understanding of the challenge to dictate the creation of a machine which did not fit the traditional mold of teams playing the game, but experienced substantial success in the competition.

<h3>Strategy</h3>

The game rules and scoring allowed for the possibility of a "chokehold" strategy. Essentially, if our machine controlled the midfield area accessible to the two adjacent machines, and performed a bare minimum of other tasks, the two adjacent teams would not be able to outscore us, regardless of what they did. Thus, while the maximum score possible in the game was 150, only 108 points were required to guarantee advancement for our chosen chokehold strategy.

Most teams focused on trying to reach the midfield gamepieces using a geometrically intuitive two jointed unfolding arm, a simple design which reflected the low priority most teams set on the midfield. We placed a much higher emphasis on the midfield battle and deliberately chose to develop a gravity powered, linearly extending system which delivered 15 lbf to prevent the full extension of other teams' jointed arms. This defensive strategy eliminated other teams' ability to score points in the midfield, and forced them to play on our terms.

<h3>Result</h3>
Our team overcame a variety of mechanical and electrical issues to reach the competition finals. The power of our defensive strategy was routinely demonstrated when, despite our machine not performing at its fullest capacity, other machines were simply incapable of carrying out their strategy and we continued to advance.

However, our mechanical issues finally caught up to us, and we finished 4th out of 60 teams in the competition.
