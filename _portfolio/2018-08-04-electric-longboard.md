<h3>Summary</h3>
Georgia Tech's campus is decently bikable and walkable, but there are some hills. I wanted a motorized means of getting over those obstacles, and an electric longboard build seemed like a good idea at the time.

In order to differentiate my build from others on campus, I implemented wireless control using an Arduino and wireless Wii nunchuck instead of a standard RC transmitter and receiver. I also created a waterjet motor mount for rapid manufacture, designed to compensate for the short shafts of standard 50mm body diameter brushless motors. These aspects of my implementation were successfully completed, and I wrapped up the project after I decided a bicycle would better fit my active lifestyle.

<h3>Features</h3>
* Motor mount clamps to caliber trucks
  - Rapid manufacturing via waterjet
  - Secondary drilling operations facilitated by 3D printed guide
* Wii Nunchuck control using Arduino
