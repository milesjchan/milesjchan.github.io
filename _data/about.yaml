# about me
first-paragraph: I am a PhD candidate in Aerospace Engineering at Caltech, advised by <a href="https://mckeon.stanford.edu/">Dr. Beverley McKeon</a> (expected graduation in March 2025). Currently my desk is at Stanford, where I also hold a Student of New Faculty designation.

research-interest: In my research, I develop reduced-order models of near-wall and roughness sublayer turbulence using resolvent analysis and characterize their capacity to improve prediction of flow physics and statistics, as well as augment wall-modeling schemes for large eddy simulations.
