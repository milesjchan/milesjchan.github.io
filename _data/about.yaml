# about me
first-paragraph: I am a PhD candidate in Aerospace Engineering at Caltech (expected graduation in 2024). I study reduced-order modeling of turbulent flows with my advisor, <a href="https://mckeon.stanford.edu/">Dr. Beverley McKeon</a>. I am currently based in Menlo Park, as my group has mostly moved over to Stanford.

second-paragraph: I grew up in San Jose, CA, so finishing my PhD at Stanford has brought me home. Here, I developed my interest in engineering, which motivated my pursuit of a BS in mechanical engineering at Georgia Tech and my MS/PhD work at Caltech. I also began pursuing music and running here, which remain my central hobbies.

research-interest: My research is in constructing low-order representations of near-wall turbulent flows which capture key aspects of the flow physics while minimizing computational expense, and leveraging those results in the context of wall-modeling for large eddy simulations and low-order predictions for engineering quantities such as drag over surface roughness.
