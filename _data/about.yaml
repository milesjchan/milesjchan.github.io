# about me
first-paragraph: I am a PhD candidate in Aerospace Engineering at Caltech (expected graduation in 2024). I study reduced-order modeling of turbulent flows with my advisor, Dr. Beverley McKeon. I am currently based in Menlo Park, as my group has mostly moved over to Stanford.
second-paragraph: I grew up in San Jose, CA, so finishing my PhD at Stanford has brought me home. Here was where I developed my interest in engineering, leading to undergraduate study in mechanical engineering at Georgia Tech and my graduate work at Caltech. I also began pursuing music and running here, which remain my central hobbies.

research-interest: My research is in constructing low-order representations of near-wall turbulent flows which capture key aspects of the flow physics while minimizing computational expense, and leveraging those results in the context of wall-modeling for large eddy simulations and low-order predictions for engineering quantities such as drag over surface roughness.
