# about me ()
first-paragraph: I am an aerospace engineer (PhD, Caltech 2025) with expertise in modeling and analysis of linear and nonlinear dynamical systems incorporating fluid dynamics, thermal effects, structural elements, and aerospace vehicles using equation- and data-driven methods. I am also experienced in mechanical design, stress analysis, machining, and rapid prototyping. I am self-driven and independent, but also a capable collaborator and communicator.

research-interest: My PhD thesis, <a href="https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/17261/">Reduced Order Modeling of Near-wall and Roughness Sublayer Turbulence</a>, documents models I developed to provide inexpensive predictions of structures, statistics, and engineering quantities-of-interest (e.g. drag) in the turbulent flow response to smooth and textured surfaces.
