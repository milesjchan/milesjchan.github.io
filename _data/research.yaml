    abstract-less: I conducted the theoretical development and software implementation of a generalizable, equation-based reduced order model for the turbulent flow response to surface roughness, using resolvent analysis with a surface-dependent forcing term. This method predicts flow features, statistics, and drag observed in rough wall channel flow with a large reduction in computational expense as measured in degrees of freedom, memory usage, and wall time. The results are compared with direct numerical simulations of rough wall channel at engineering-relevant friction Reynolds numbers. The work is documented in my thesis and an upcoming publication. Skills used include MATLAB, MPI, C++, data visualization and analysis, pre- and post-processing of simulation inputs/results.

introduction: Turbulent fluid flow is a highly multi-scale, nonlinear physical system. Simulating turbulent flows requires memory- and CPU-intensive computations, and the resulting high-dimensional data is challenging to interpret. In my research, I develop methods for reduced-order modeling of near-wall and roughness sublayer turbulence. Day-to-day, my work includes running computational fluid dynamics simulations on high-performance computing clusters, developing meaningful data analyses and flow visualizations, and constructing reduced-order representations which capture key flow features using spectral and modal analysis techniques. I also use theory- and equation-driven methods, in particular resolvent analysis of the Navier-Stokes equations, to construct predictive low-order models.
