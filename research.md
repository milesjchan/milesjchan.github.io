    <h4 class="media-heading">Wombat Cubic Feces</h4>
    <p>Wombats are herbivorous marsupials native to Australia, which have the distinctive feature of producing cubic feces. In the man-made world, cubic structures are produced by extrusion or injection molding, but there are few examples of this feat in nature. As an undergrad researcher in the Hu Laboratory for Biolocomotion at Georgia Tech, I investigated how wombats produce cubic feces by examining wombat intestine specimens. Through conducting photographic studies and performing experiments, I characterized the phenomena and its physical cause. <strong>This work is in progress.</strong></p>

    <h4 class="media-heading">Elephant Sniffing Velocity</h4>
    <p>Elephants are capable of grasping a wide variety of objects, due to their combination of mechanical gripping and air suction. In order to validate theoretical predictions for the air speed generated during particular grabbing actions, I developed a test stand for taking air velocity measurements using hot wire anemometry while an elephant is grabbing an object. I specified the system components, including equipment from Dantec and National Instruments, and developed MATLAB code to calibrate the anemometer, record measurements, and display live data. <strong>This work is in progress.</strong></p>
