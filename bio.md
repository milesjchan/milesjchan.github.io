<h3>Education</h3>
<p>Georgia Tech | B.S. Mechanical Engineering 2019 | GPA 3.90/4.00<br> - Minor in Aerospace Engineering<br> - Concentration in Automation and Robotics</p>

<h3>About</h3>
<p class="text-justify">I'm passionate about studying fundamental physical principles, how they manifest themselves in nature, and their implementation in man-made machines. My desire to learn how things work drew me to mechanical engineering as an undergrad, and eventually to research studying fluid and soft matter flow in biological systems in the <a href="http://www.hu.gatech.edu/">Hu Laboratory for Biolocomotion</a> under Dr. David Hu. Completing a co-op at Honda Aircraft, with semesters spent in the mechanical systems, flight sciences, and stress groups, opened my eyes to the interesting world of aerodynamics and all things aviation-related.</p>

<p class="text-justify">I also volunteer at the <a href="http://inventionstudio.gatech.edu/">Invention Studio at Georgia Tech</a>, a maker space which provides over 1000 students and faculty per month access to manual tools, 3D printers, laser cutters, waterjets, and other machines. As a prototyping instructor, I have spent over 200 hours teaching users how to use our tools safely and effectively. I have spent many additional hours in my leadership role as a waterjet master, working tirelessly to maintain our waterjets, write usage guides, and define the ongoing development of our capabilities.</p>

<p class="text-justify">In my free time, I enjoy hanging out in the maker space, working on small devices which showcase interesting physical phenomena, including my model airplanes. My interactions with other students, and seeing the wonderful projects they come in with, have always given me great joy.</p>
