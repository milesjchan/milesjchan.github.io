    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>I'm passionate about studying fundamental physical principles, how they manifest themselves in nature, and their implementation in man-made machines. My desire to learn how things work drew me to mechanical engineering as an undergrad, and eventually to research studying soft matter flow in biological systems. Interning at Honda Aircraft opened my eyes to the interesting world of aerodynamics and all things aviation-related.</p>

    <p>I also volunteer as a prototyping instructor at the Invention Studio at Georgia Tech, in exchange for 24/7 access to manual tools, 3D printers, laser cutters, waterjets, and other machines. I like working on small devices which showcase interesting physical phenomena, including my model airplanes. I especially enjoy seeing other students bring in their cool personal, research, and class projects.</p>
