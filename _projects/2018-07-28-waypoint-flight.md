    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>Like most projects, this started fairly simply. Grab .pdf plans for the FT Explorer online, modify them in Inkscape, and laser cut the components out of Dollar Tree foam board. Glue together, spray paint for visibility, stick a 6 channel receiver inside, set up transmitter mixes, and go fly.</p>

    <p>I decided to make the FT Explorer smarter by adding a flight controller and GPS unit. I flashed iNav software to the flight controller, which allows me to set up channel mixing, PID gains, and flight modes. The flight modes include horizon hold, altitude hold, and return to home routines.</p>

    <p>I was able to trim the aircraft and achieve hands-free, stabilized flight using the horizon and altitude hold modes.</p>
