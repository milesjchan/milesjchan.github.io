<h3>Summary</h3>
The sophomore level mechanical engineering design class at Georgia Tech is called ME2110. Students design and build autonomous machines to play a game conceived by the course instructors. Generally, machines have to extend to the center of the field to accomplish a high point value game task, and they must defend their side of the field, sweeping certain game pieces in or out for points. Four machines are on the field at a time, and the 2 teams with the highest point values at the end of a 1 minute round advance.

I had a great team for this competition, and we agreed on an unconventional but effective strategy which got us to the final round. We understood that the objective was to create a positive points differential against two other teams on the field during a match, and focused on limiting our two adjacent opponents' scoring ability as much as possible.

<h3>Strategy</h3>

The game rules and scoring allowed for the possibility of a "chokehold" strategy. Essentially, if our machine controlled the midfield area accessible to the two adjacent machines, and performed a bare minimum of other tasks, the two adjacent teams would not be able to outscore us. Thus, while the maximum score possible in the game was 150, only 108 points were required to guarantee advancement.

Most teams focused on trying to reach the midfield gamepieces using a geometrically intuitive two jointed unfolding arm. We deliberately chose to develop a gravity powered, linearly extending system which delivered 15 lbf to prevent the full extension of other teams' jointed arms. By eliminating our opponents' midfield scoring abilities, we were able to guarantee a positive points differential with adjacent opponents.

<h3>Result</h3>

Our team overcame a variety of mechanical and electrical issues to reach the competition finals. The power of our defensive strategy was routinely demonstrated when, despite our machine not performing at its fullest capacity, other machines were simply incapable of carrying out their strategy and we continued to advance.

However, our mechanical issues finally caught up to us, and we finished 4th out of 60 teams in the competition.
